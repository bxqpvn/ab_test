In this analysis, we conducted an A/B test comparing two user groups for a yoga mobile app. Group A was offered a subscription at the regular price, while Group B received the same subscription at a 50% discount. Using a T-test to analyze conversion rates, we found that Group B performed significantly better, leading to the recommendation of applying the discounted offer to increase future conversion rates.
